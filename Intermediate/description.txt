ME -> checks for the above two value for this condition (ME is more than) and if the value is true execute the next statement otherwise check 
      for the end of this condition

ADD -> pop two values from the stack and add the values and then push it onto stack

PRINT m -> print the value of this variable (can add a condition of visiting the child i.e. variable first and push it on to stack and when 
          print is encountered print it)
          
Wstart -> nxt statements will be the statement of while loop. the following values inside will be the conditions statement till Whiletrue.

Whiletrue ->  if the above condition was evaluated to true execute below statements till you encounter Go WStart. If this is false skip the lines and go to WEnd
